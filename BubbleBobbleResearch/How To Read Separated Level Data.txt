Reading "SeperatedLevelData.dat"

levels 100
blocks wide per level 32
blocks high per level 25
blocks per byte 8

read (100 * 32 * 25) / 8 | unsigned char ( 1 byte )

to know what tile is what you bit mask starting at
0b1000 0000 for the first tile		(1)
0b0100 0000 for the second tile		(2)
0b0010 0000 for the third tile		(3)
0b0001 0000 for the fourth tile 	(4)
0b0000 1000 for the fift tile 		(5)
0b0000 0100 for the sixth tile 		(6)
0b0000 0010 for the seventh tile	(7)
0b0000 0001 for the eight tile 		(8)

A line is made up of 4 bytes
12345678 12345678 12345678 12345678 for 1 line do this times 25 for a level

To know the BASE tile texture of each level it starts from
the topleft of "blocks.png" starting at level 1 for each next level it moves to the right
each block is 8x8 pixels

left = 		((levelNr - 1) % 10) * 8;
bottom = 	((levelNr - 1) / 10) * 8;
width = 	8;
height =	8; 

Wall Tiles Currently not a clue on how to read those in;
