Enemy data is 3 Bytes per Enemy

To read Read 1 byte if that byte is equal to 0b00000000
this means that it is the end of the current level
if not read the next 2 bytes ( those 3 bytes are for 1 enemys data in the current level )

topleft of level = collumn 0 row 0

ENEMY DATA

Byte 1 Mask 0b00000111 = enemy type

000 = Zen chan
110 = Mighta
100 = Monsta
011 = Pulpul
010 = Banebou
001 = Hidegons
101 = Drunk
111 = Invader

Byte 1 Mask 0b11111000 = collumn has offset = to (<< 3)
to fix this -> collumn = (collumn >> 3)

Byte 2 Mask 0b11111000 = row has offset = to (<< 3)
to fix this -> row = (row >> 3)

Byte 2 Mask 0b00000100 = Unknown Bool 1
Byte 2 Mask 0b00000010 = Unknown Bool 2
Byte 2 Mask 0b00000001 = Unknown Bool 3

Byte 3 Mask 0b10000000 = Unknown Bool 4
Byte 3 Mask 0b01000000 = Unknown Bool 5
Byte 3 Mask 0b00100000 = Unknown Bool 6

Byte 3 Mask 0b00011111 = delay has offset = to (>> 1)
to fix this -> delay = (delay << 1)
delay = nr of frame of delay
actual delay time = delay * 0.017f ( 17 ms +- );
